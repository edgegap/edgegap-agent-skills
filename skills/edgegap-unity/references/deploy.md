## 1. Edgegap access

**Account:** free at https://app.edgegap.com/auth/register (verify the email, or registry/plugin steps fail). No credit card for testing.

**API token** (needed for creating the app/version, deploying, logs): Dashboard → User Settings → Tokens, https://app.edgegap.com/user-settings?tab=tokens. It is organization-wide and can't be scoped, so treat it like a password:
- Never write it into project files, scripts, Dockerfiles, git, or the game client.
- Never echo it back in chat or logs.
- It is *not* the matchmaker Auth Token (that one is client-safe).

**Connect the Edgegap MCP server** (hosted, `https://mcp.edgegap.dev/mcp`). First check whether tools named like `edgegap_list_apps` are already available and work; if so, skip this.

If this skill was installed through the `edgegap` Claude Code plugin, the plugin already declares the MCP server and reads the token from the `EDGEGAP_API_TOKEN` environment variable (just the UUID). Ask the developer to set it in their own shell profile or system environment variables, then restart Claude Code. Windows: `setx EDGEGAP_API_TOKEN <uuid>`. macOS/Linux: `export EDGEGAP_API_TOKEN=<uuid>` in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`.

Otherwise ask the developer to run this in their own terminal, so the token never passes through the conversation:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http edgegap https://mcp.edgegap.dev/mcp -H "Authorization: token <YOUR_EDGEGAP_API_TOKEN>" --scope user
```

Then restart the Claude Code session (or `/mcp` to reconnect) so the tools load. `Bearer <token>` also works as the header value.

Checks if the tools fail:
- "does not contain an Edgegap API token": the header is malformed. Most often it's `token token <uuid>`, because the copied value already had the prefix. Fix it with `claude mcp remove edgegap --scope user` and add it again.
- Tools named `edgegap_*` that come from a claude.ai/desktop **connector** (no header) fail the same way. Make sure the configured `edgegap` server is the one in use.
- In the Claude desktop app, a newly added user-scope server may only appear after the app or session fully restarts.

If the developer prefers to paste the token to you, run that command for them with the Bash tool, and don't repeat the token in your messages.

Other clients:
- **Claude Desktop / claude.ai custom connectors can't send the Authorization header**, so the hosted URL shows "connected" but every tool fails. For Claude Desktop use the local server instead: Settings → Developer → Edit Config:
  ```json
  { "mcpServers": { "edgegap": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@edgegap/mcp"] } } }
  ```
  It asks for the token on first use (or set `"env": {"EDGEGAP_API_TOKEN": "..."}`). Needs Node 18+.
- Cursor/VS Code: same URL + header in their MCP config.

If MCP is impossible, everything below can be done in the dashboard (apps at https://app.edgegap.com/application-management/applications/list, deploy button on the version). Guide the developer click by click and ask them to paste results (deployment URL, external port, logs).

## 2. Prerequisites check

Verify instead of asking where possible:
- **Unity version**: `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` (`m_EditorVersion`). SDK needs 2021.3+.
- **Unity Linux modules**: Unity Hub → Installs → (version) → Add Modules → **Linux Build Support (Mono and/or IL2CPP)** + **Linux Dedicated Server Build Support**, then restart Unity. Check on disk: the editor folder contains `PlaybackEngines/LinuxStandaloneSupport` (Windows: `<Editor>\Data\PlaybackEngines\LinuxStandaloneSupport`; macOS: `/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/<ver>/PlaybackEngines/LinuxStandaloneSupport`), and its `Variations` folder has `*server*` entries for Dedicated Server. On Windows, Unity 6 projects also need the `com.unity.toolchain.win-x86_64-linux` toolchain package. Unity usually prompts, or add it if the build complains about the Linux toolchain/sysroot.
- **Docker**: `docker version` (client and server both answer). If the server part fails, start Docker Desktop.
- **git** (for UPM git packages): `git --version`.

## 3. Build the Linux dedicated server

Before building: the scene with the network manager + `EdgegapServerLifecycle` must be enabled in Build Settings, and the netcode adapter must compile. Build *after* adding the lifecycle script, or the image won't self-stop.

**Option A, command line (agent-driven).** Copy `assets/unity/Editor/EdgegapServerBuild.cs` into `Assets/Edgegap/Editor/`. The project must be **closed** in the Unity Editor (batchmode refuses a project that's already open). Ask the developer to close it, or use option B.

Unity editor path from the version in ProjectVersion.txt:
- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\<ver>\Editor\Unity.exe`
- macOS: `/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/<ver>/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity`
- Linux: `~/Unity/Hub/Editor/<ver>/Editor/Unity`

(Unity Hub may use a custom install location. Ask if the path doesn't exist.)

```bash
"<Unity>" -batchmode -quit -projectPath "<project>" -executeMethod EdgegapServerBuild.Build -logFile build-server.log
```
First run imports the whole project and can take many minutes, so run it in the background and watch the log. Success: `EdgegapServerBuild | Succeeded` and `Builds/EdgegapServer/ServerBuild` exists. Read the log for `error CS` on failure. Server-only compile errors (code referencing UnityEditor, client-only APIs) show up here first.

**Option B, in the Editor (developer clicks).** Menu **Tools → Edgegap → Build Linux Dedicated Server** (from the same script), or File → Build Profiles → **Linux Server** (Dedicated Server) → build to `Builds/EdgegapServer/ServerBuild`. The executable must be named `ServerBuild` for the Dockerfile.

**Option C, the Edgegap Unity plugin** (`https://github.com/edgegap/edgegap-unity-plugin.git#3.2.1`, menu **Tools → Edgegap Server Hosting**). It builds, containerizes and pushes with buttons, and is a good choice for developers who prefer a UI. Caveats: it pre-fills the dashboard version with port 7770/UDP named "Game Port" (change it to your transport's port/protocol and name `gameport`); its Dockerfile prints all env vars, including the self-stop token, into logs; its local-test mock env keys ports by number, not name.

## 4. Docker image and registry push

Copy `assets/docker/Dockerfile` and `assets/docker/.dockerignore` to the **project root** (merge with an existing `.dockerignore`: the build context should contain only `Builds/EdgegapServer`). Change `EXPOSE` to match the transport (documentation only). Or generate one with `edgegap_generate_dockerfile` (`engine: "unity"`, `netcode`, `ports`) and check an existing one with `edgegap_validate_server_config`.

**Tag**: never `latest`, never reuse a tag (Edgegap caches by tag). Use a timestamp, e.g. `2026.10.09-1530`. No spaces.

**Registry credentials**: Edgegap Container Registry page, https://app.edgegap.com/registry-management/repositories/list: **Project**, **Username** (`robot$...+client-push`), **Token**. (`edgegap_get_registry_credentials` returns 403 for normal API tokens, so don't rely on it; it only works with plugin quick-start tokens.) Ask the developer to log in themselves so the registry token stays out of the chat:

```bash
docker login registry.edgegap.com -u '<username>'
```
(PowerShell/cmd: drop the quotes or keep single quotes in PowerShell; `$` in the username must not be expanded by bash, so keep single quotes there.)

Then, from the project root:
```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t registry.edgegap.com/<project>/<image>:<tag> .
docker push registry.edgegap.com/<project>/<image>:<tag>
```
`--platform linux/amd64` is mandatory on Apple Silicon/ARM (otherwise the deployment crashes with an exec/"not found" error) and harmless elsewhere. Image name: lowercase, e.g. the game name.

Confirm with `edgegap_list_registry_tags` (`image_name`: the image name only, without project or tag).

Optional local smoke test before pushing: `docker run --rm -p 7777:7777/udp registry.edgegap.com/<project>/<image>:<tag>` (WS/TCP: `/tcp`) and connect a client to `127.0.0.1:7777`.

Other registries (Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR, GitLab) work too. Use their host as `docker_repository` and their credentials on the version.

## 5. App and app version

`edgegap_list_apps` first (avoid duplicates; free tier allows 2 apps and 2 versions). Then `edgegap_create_app` (`name`, e.g. the game name in kebab-case) if needed.

`edgegap_create_app_version`:
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| application | the app |
| name | version name, e.g. `v1` or the image tag |
| docker_repository | `registry.edgegap.com` (host only, no scheme) |
| docker_image | `<project>/<image>` |
| docker_tag | the pushed tag |
| cpu_units / memory_mb | start with `1024` / `2048` (1 vCPU, 2 GB). Free tier max 1536 / 3072. memory ≤ 2 × cpu |
| ports | `[{"port": <internal listen port>, "protocol": "UDP"|"TCP"|"WS", "name": "gameport"}]`; add `"tls_upgrade": true` on WS ports for WebGL/wss clients |
| registry_username / registry_token | **required even for registry.edgegap.com**: Edgegap pulls with the version's credentials, not the API token. Without them deployments fail to pull (424 / image pull error) |
| max_duration_minutes | leave default (60 on hosted MCP) |
| verify_image | `true` once credentials are set |

Registry credentials are a secret. Two acceptable ways:
1. Developer pastes username/token for this call (they only grant registry access). Don't repeat them in chat or write them anywhere.
2. Create the version without them, then the developer opens the version in the dashboard → Edit → **Private registry** "Username Token"/"Password Token", saves.

Either way, verify with `edgegap_list_app_versions`: it reports `registry_credentials_set` (presence only) and `tls_upgrade` per port. `edgegap_create_app_version` also returns `notes` warning when a registry.edgegap.com image has no login. Read them. In the real end-to-end test the developer was asked for the credentials and still skipped the field, and the first deploy failed with `Unable to pull image from registry`.

**WebGL / WebSocket transport**: the port must be `WS` with `"tls_upgrade": true` (Edgegap terminates TLS for `*.pr.edgegap.net`, so the server stays plain ws). `edgegap_generate_dockerfile` with a WS netcode already returns `ports_for_create_app_version` with it set. If the connected MCP is older than 0.3.3 and has no `tls_upgrade` field, the developer ticks **TLS Upgrade** on the port in the dashboard instead.

Dashboard version settings worth knowing: **Restart policy** "Never" is recommended (process exit stops the deployment); env vars (mark secrets hidden); Duplicate button to change ports/resources without rebuilding.

## 6. Direct test deployment

Do this before the matchmaker. It proves image, ports, and netcode work, and isolates later matchmaker issues.

1. `edgegap_deploy` with `application`, `version`, `users: {"ip_addresses": ["<developer public IP>"]}` (ask, or get it from `curl -s https://api.ipify.org`), `tags: ["mcp-test"]`. Costs a little (free tier: free, 1 at a time).
2. `edgegap_wait_for_deployment` → `fqdn`, `public_ip`, `ports[].external`.
3. `edgegap_get_deployment_logs`: expect the server startup lines, transport listening, and `Edgegap Server | Deployment '...' started`. A crash loop or OOM shows here.
4. Connect a client to it directly: Editor play mode with the transport address/port set to `public_ip`/`fqdn` + external port (WS + TLS: `wss://fqdn:external`). The server may need up to ~1 min after Ready before it accepts connections. Optionally write a temporary "Direct Connect" field in the client for this.
5. `edgegap_stop_deployment` when done. **Free tier allows one deployment at a time; a leftover test deployment blocks matchmaker deployments.**

With `FirstPlayerTimeoutSeconds = 120`, the lifecycle script stops a direct deployment that nobody joins within 2 minutes. Raise it temporarily while debugging, or connect quickly.

## 7. MCP tool caveats (@edgegap/mcp 0.3.3+, hosted and npm)

- `edgegap_get_registry_credentials`: 403 with normal API tokens (only plugin quick-start tokens work). Use the dashboard Container Registry page.
- `edgegap_list_registry_tags`: image name only.
- `edgegap_create_app_version`: accepts `tls_upgrade` per WS/HTTP port; still creates a version without registry credentials if you omit them, but says so in `notes`.
- `edgegap_list_app_versions`: shows `registry_credentials_set` and per-port `tls_upgrade`. Use it to verify the version before deploying.
- `edgegap_build_matchmaker_config`: accepts `allowed_cors_origins` (origins only, no path or trailing slash).
- Error texts carry per-tool hints (404/400/429). An unknown `request_id` is a 400 on the live API.
- Older servers (0.3.2 and earlier) lack `tls_upgrade`/`allowed_cors_origins`. If the tool schema doesn't list them, set TLS Upgrade in the dashboard and add `allowed_cors_origins` to the JSON by hand.
- Logs exist only while a deployment runs (unless Endpoint Storage is configured). Read them before stopping a failed deployment.
- Deployments cost money outside the free tier. Tag test deployments, and stop every deployment you started before ending.
- Don't enumerate or modify apps the developer didn't mention. The token is org-wide.

## 8. Free tier limits

1 concurrent deployment; deployments stop after 60 min; 2 apps; 2 app versions; 5 GB registry; 1.5 vCPU / 3 GB per deployment; matchmaker stops 3 h after each start (restart from dashboard). Errors: `You have reached you Application limit of 2`, `... Application Version limit of 2` → delete or reuse an old version (dashboard), or upgrade.
