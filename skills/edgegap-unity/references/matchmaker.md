## 1. How it fits together

```
Client ──POST /groups (profile, attributes)──▶ Matchmaker ──match found──▶ Edgegap deploys app/version near players
Client ◀──poll: SEARCHING → MATCH_FOUND → HOST_ASSIGNED {fqdn, public_ip, ports{gameport:{external}}}──┘
Client ──connect fqdn/public_ip : external port──▶ Dedicated server (env: MM_TICKET_IDS, MM_MATCH_ID, ...)
```

- The matchmaker is a hosted service the developer creates in the dashboard. There is no public API to create one. `edgegap_build_matchmaker_config` only produces the JSON.
- Each profile points at one `application.name` + `application.version`. The app version must exist and be active, so create and test it first.
- Matchmaker version: `3.3.2` (latest as of 2026-10). `TEAM_FOUND` status is deprecated since 3.3.0; teams are assigned at `MATCH_FOUND`.

## 2. Designing the profile

Ask only what you can't infer from the game:
- Players per match (min/max), and teams? (1 team = co-op / free-for-all / battle royale; 2 teams = 2v2 etc.)
- Should a lone player eventually get a server alone? For first tests, yes: an expansion that lowers `min_team_size` to 1 after ~30 s lets one person test end to end.
- Platforms: any WebGL client → no `latencies` rule for that profile + `allowed_cors_origins`.
- Desktop/mobile only → a `latencies` rule (beacons) is fine and improves placement, but the client must then send beacons in every ticket (`UseLatencyBeacons = true`).
- Skill/mode/map filters? Each adds a rule and a matching ticket attribute. Skip them for the first end-to-end run and add them afterwards.

## 3. Config schema essentials

Top level: `version` ("3.3.2"), `inspect` (true in dev: enables `GET /inspect/tickets|matches`; turn off for live), `max_deployment_retry_count` (3), optional `allowed_cors_origins` (exact origins `https://host[:port]`, no path/trailing slash; wildcard subdomains `https://*.example.com` allowed), `profiles` (map name → profile).

Profile: `ticket_expiration_period` ("5m"; unmatched tickets become CANCELLED), `ticket_removal_period` ("1m"), `group_inactivity_removal_period` ("5m"), `application {name, version}`, `rules {initial, expansions}`.

Rule types in `rules.initial` (each `{ "type": ..., "attributes": {...} }`, rule names are free-form; the name is also the ticket attribute key):
- `player_count` (required, exactly once): `team_count`, `min_team_size`, `max_team_size`. Fills to max if possible, otherwise makes a partial match (≥ min) when the expansion stage/expiration elapses. Never below min.
- `latencies` (optional, once): `difference` (max ms difference between players to the same beacon), `max_latency` (beacons above are discarded). Ticket attribute: `{"Chicago": 12.3, ...}`.
- `number_difference`: `max_difference`. Ticket attribute: a number (e.g. `elo_rating`).
- `string_equality`: no attributes. Ticket attribute: a string; case-sensitive exact match.
- `intersection`: `overlap`. Ticket attribute: array of strings (e.g. maps, modes, `backfill_group_size`).

`rules.expansions`: `{ "<seconds since ticket creation>": { "<rule name>": { <attributes to overwrite> } } }`, `{}` for none. Each key must be < ticket expiration or it never fires.

Duration strings: `"30s"`, `"5m"`. Validate the final JSON (`python -m json.tool file.json`). Some docs examples are missing commas, so never copy them blindly.

## 4. Templates

Write the final file as `matchmaker-config.json` in the project root (it contains no secrets). Replace `application.name`/`version` with the real ones.

**Casual, WebGL-safe (no beacons), solo after 30 s**: the verified end-to-end shape (`assets/matchmaker/casual.json`):
```json
{
  "version": "3.3.2",
  "inspect": true,
  "max_deployment_retry_count": 3,
  "allowed_cors_origins": ["http://localhost:8080"],
  "profiles": {
    "casual": {
      "ticket_expiration_period": "5m",
      "ticket_removal_period": "1m",
      "group_inactivity_removal_period": "5m",
      "application": { "name": "my-game", "version": "v1" },
      "rules": {
        "initial": {
          "match_size": {
            "type": "player_count",
            "attributes": { "team_count": 1, "min_team_size": 2, "max_team_size": 4 }
          }
        },
        "expansions": {
          "30": { "match_size": { "min_team_size": 1 } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Remove `allowed_cors_origins` if there is no WebGL client.

**Desktop with latency beacons, 2 teams of 2** (`assets/matchmaker/teams-latency.json`): adds
```json
"beacons": { "type": "latencies", "attributes": { "difference": 100, "max_latency": 200 } }
```
to `initial`, `team_count: 2`, `min_team_size: 2`, `max_team_size: 2`, and expansions that relax latency (`"30": {"beacons": {"max_latency": 300}}`) and allow `min_team_size: 1` late for testing.

Prefer generating with `edgegap_build_matchmaker_config` (it also checks the app version exists and has ports). It takes `profile_name`, `application`, `version`, `team_count`, `min_team_size`, `max_team_size`, optional `max_latency_ms`, `latency_difference_ms`, `expansions[{after_seconds, min_team_size?, max_latency_ms?}]`, `ticket_expiration`, and `allowed_cors_origins` (needed for WebGL; older MCP servers without this field: add the top-level key to the JSON yourself).

## 5. Creating the matchmaker in the dashboard

There is no API for this step, so walk the developer through it and wait for them:

1. Open https://app.edgegap.com/matchmaker-management-v2/matchmakers/list (sidebar: **Matchmaker**).
2. Click **Create Matchmaker**. Enter a name (e.g. `mygame-dev`) and **upload** (or paste) `matchmaker-config.json`.
3. If it shows `The application configuration is not valid for profile X`, the `application.name`/`version` don't match an existing active app version. Fix and re-upload. `Docker image ... is not cached` is only a warning on free tier, so proceed.
4. Click **Create and Start**. Free tier runs on a shared cluster and **shuts down 3 hours after each start**. Restart it from the list. URL and token stay the same across restarts.
5. When Status is **ONLINE**, copy the **API URL** and **Auth Token** and paste them here (or directly into the `EdgegapMatchmakingClient` component). The Auth Token is the *matchmaker* token: it is safe to ship in game clients and gives no access to the Edgegap account. It is not the Edgegap API token.
6. DNS can take up to ~5 minutes after the first start. Check `curl -s -H "Authorization: <auth token>" <API URL>/monitor` until it answers.

Cleanup order: a matchmaker (even stopped) blocks disabling, renaming or deleting the app/version it references. Delete the matchmaker in the dashboard first (no API), then the version and app.

Updating: editing the config of a running matchmaker does a quick reload (all tickets are deleted, short downtime). Changing `version` needs **Stop → Edit → Start**. When the app version changes (new build), update `application.version` in the config the same way. Forgetting this means matches keep deploying the old build.

## 6. Ticket ↔ profile contract

Tickets are validated against the profile:
- `profile` in the ticket must equal a profile name in the config (`EdgegapMatchmakingClient.Profile`).
- Every rule **except `player_count`** must be present as an attribute with the rule's name as key (e.g. `beacons`, `elo_rating`), and **unknown attributes are rejected**. A mismatch gives HTTP 400 on `POST /groups`.
- So: profile has `latencies` rule ⇔ client sends `beacons` (`UseLatencyBeacons = true`, never on WebGL). Add one field to `GameTicketAttributes` per extra rule, with `[JsonProperty("<rule name>")]`.
- Beacons are measured with ICMP; a 0 value means the ping failed. The client template drops 0 values.

## 7. What the server receives

On matchmaker-created deployments Edgegap injects (parsed by `MatchEnvironmentDTO<GameTicketAttributes>`): `MM_MATCH_ID`, `MM_MATCH_PROFILE`, `MM_EXPANSION`, `MM_TICKET_IDS` (JSON array), `MM_TICKET_<id>` (JSON ticket with `player_ip`, `group_id`, `team_id`, `attributes`), `MM_GROUPS`, `MM_TEAMS`, `MM_EQUALITY`, `MM_INTERSECTION`. Plus the usual `ARBITRIUM_*` deployment variables.

Uses: expected player count (`TicketIds.Count`) to start the match when everyone is in, team assignment, and validating joiners: the client sends `EdgegapMatchmakingClient.TicketId` in its connection payload and the server checks it is in `MM_TICKET_IDS`. That handshake is optional for a first playtest; it's netcode-specific code you write.

The server should allow ~60 s for matched players to connect before giving up on them.

## 8. Matchmaker troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Monitor call fails right after creation | DNS propagation, wait ~5 min |
| CORS error in browser console | origin missing from `allowed_cors_origins` (scheme + host + port exactly) |
| 400 on create group | profile name or attributes don't match the config (section 6) |
| 401 | wrong matchmaker token, or "Bearer "/"token " prefix added (send it raw) |
| Stuck in SEARCHING | not enough compatible tickets; for solo tests add the `min_team_size: 1` expansion, check latency rule isn't excluding players |
| Flips MATCH_FOUND ↔ SEARCHING | deployment can't start: free tier allows **1 concurrent deployment**. Stop leftover test deployments (`edgegap_list_deployments`, `edgegap_stop_deployment`). Also check the app version (registry credentials, image tag) by doing a direct deploy |
| Straight to CANCELLED | ticket expired; raise `ticket_expiration_period` or add expansions |
| Matches at random times ignoring player count | stale tickets from earlier tests: restart the matchmaker |
| 404 while polling | ticket/group removed (expired, or deleted) |
| Matchmaker OFFLINE | free tier 3-hour shutdown: restart it |
| HOST_ASSIGNED but client can't connect | it's a server/port problem, not matchmaker: see troubleshooting.md "connection" |
