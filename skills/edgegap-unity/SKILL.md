description: 'Unity + Edgegap: get a Unity multiplayer game online with dedicated servers and matchmaking, end to end. Load this before using any Edgegap MCP tool on a Unity project: it has the Unity workflow, tested C# templates (matchmaker client, server self-stop), Linux server build, Dockerfile, matchmaker config and fixes for known pitfalls. Use when a Unity dev wants online play: "put my game online", "play with people over the internet", "works on LAN/same wifi but not online", "nobody should have to host", "click Play and get matched", how Fall Guys/Among Us match players, servers for a playtest, "where do I start with servers". Also for NGO, Mirror or FishNet host/client games moving to dedicated servers, WebGL multiplayer, or debugging Edgegap deployments, ports or matchmaking for a Unity game. Use even for beginners who never say Edgegap, servers or Docker. Not for Unreal/Godot/non-game backends.'

# Edgegap for Unity: dedicated servers + matchmaking

Goal: a player clicks **Find Match**, the Edgegap matchmaker groups players, Edgegap starts a dedicated server near them, every client connects automatically, and the server shuts itself down when the match ends. The job is done when that loop works end to end with real builds, not when the code compiles.

Use **dedicated (authoritative) servers only**; never relays. A dedicated server owns the game state, so no player hosts, has a latency advantage, or can end the match by quitting. That is exactly what "nobody should have to host" and "works on LAN but not online" are asking for.

## How to work

- **Be the engineer, not a tutorial.** Inspect the project, write the code, run the builds and Docker commands, call the Edgegap MCP tools, and read the logs yourself. Hand the developer only what truly needs them: clicks in the Unity Editor or Edgegap dashboard, secrets, and playtesting with their own eyes.
- **Meet the developer where they are.** Beginners ("I've never done this") get a two-line picture of the architecture and plain words; skip jargon like "authoritative" unless explained. Experienced devs get terse steps.
- **One layer at a time.** Each phase ends with a check that proves it works before the next starts. When something breaks, you then know which layer broke.
- **Secrets.** The Edgegap **API token** and **registry token** are account secrets: never write them into files, code, git, or chat output (see `references/deploy.md` §1). The **matchmaker Auth Token** is client-safe by design and goes in the game client.
- **Money.** Deployments cost money outside the free tier. Tag test deployments, stop the ones you start, and never leave one running at the end. Free tier allows only one deployment at a time, so a forgotten test deployment silently blocks matchmaking.
- Track the phases below as a todo list so nothing gets skipped across a long session.

## Phase 0: Understand the project (read before asking)

Inspect, don't interrogate:
- `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` (Unity version), `Packages/manifest.json` (netcode: `com.unity.netcode.gameobjects`, Mirror, FishNet; existing `com.edgegap.*`), `Assets/` for Mirror/FishNet folders and an embedded Edgegap plugin.
- `ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset`: which scenes are enabled; which one has the network manager.
- Network bootstrapping code: how the game starts host/server/client today (grep `StartHost`, `StartServer`, `StartClient`, `NetworkManager`), the transport and its port.
- Target platforms: WebGL in build profiles or mentioned? This changes the transport and matchmaker config.

Then ask, in a single message, only what you couldn't infer. Typically: players per match and teams; whether a browser (WebGL) build matters; whether they have an Edgegap account and Docker installed. Give your recommended defaults so they can just say "yes".

**No multiplayer at all yet?** That's a bigger job: pick a netcode (`references/netcode.md` §1) and get two players working on localhost first. Say so honestly and scope it with the developer before touching Edgegap.

## Phase 1: Make the game dedicated-server ready

Read `references/netcode.md`.
1. Convert host/client assumptions to a headless server path (§2): server builds call `StartServer`, players spawn on client connect, no local player on the server, headless-unsafe code guarded.
2. Server listens on `0.0.0.0` at a fixed internal port (7777 typical; WebSocket transports often 7778).
3. Install the Edgegap SDK. Add `"com.edgegap.unity-sdk": "https://github.com/edgegap/edgegap-unity-sdk.git#3.5.5"` to `Packages/manifest.json` (3.5.5+ required for WebGL; needs git). Newtonsoft comes with it.
4. Copy `assets/unity/EdgegapMatchmakingDTOs.cs`, `EdgegapServerLifecycle.cs`, `EdgegapMatchmakingClient.cs`, `link.xml` and `Editor/*.cs` into `Assets/Edgegap/` (the Editor scripts go in `Assets/Edgegap/Editor/`). Fill both `NETCODE ADAPTER` regions with the snippets for the project's netcode (§4). If the project's code lives in an asmdef, put these scripts in or reference it from that asmdef, and reference `Edgegap.SDK`.
5. Add both components to the network scene with `EdgegapSceneSetup` instead of hand-editing scene YAML (project closed in the Editor):
   `"<Unity>" -batchmode -quit -projectPath "<project>" -executeMethod EdgegapSceneSetup.Setup -edgegapListenPort <port> -edgegapAutoStart <false if the netcode already auto-starts headless> -edgegapProfile <profile> -logFile setup.log`
   (Or menu **Tools → Edgegap → Add Edgegap Components To Open Scene**.) Run it again later with `-edgegapBaseUrl`/`-edgegapAuthToken` once the matchmaker exists.

✅ Check: the game still works locally with one instance as dedicated server and one as client (`references/netcode.md` §6).

## Phase 2: Connect to Edgegap

Read `references/deploy.md` §1-2. Make sure the developer has an account, Docker running, and the Unity Linux Build Support + Linux Dedicated Server modules. Then get the Edgegap MCP connected with their API token: with the `edgegap` plugin they set `EDGEGAP_API_TOKEN` in their environment; otherwise they run the `claude mcp add ...` command in their own terminal. Either way they restart the session afterwards. Common slip: the header must be exactly `Authorization: token <uuid>`. A token pasted with its own `token ` prefix becomes `token token <uuid>` and is rejected as "not an Edgegap API token".

✅ Check: `edgegap_list_apps` succeeds.

## Phase 3: Build, containerize, push

Read `references/deploy.md` §3-4.
1. Build the Linux dedicated server to `Builds/EdgegapServer/ServerBuild`: by command line with `assets/unity/Editor/EdgegapServerBuild.cs` (project must be closed in the Editor), or the developer clicks the menu item.
2. Copy `assets/docker/Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` to the project root.
3. Developer runs `docker login registry.edgegap.com` with the credentials from the dashboard Container Registry page. You run `docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t registry.edgegap.com/<project>/<image>:<tag> .` and `docker push`, with a fresh tag every build and never `latest`.
4. Optional but cheap: `docker run` locally and connect a client to it.

✅ Check: `edgegap_list_registry_tags` shows the tag.

## Phase 4: App, version, direct deploy

Read `references/deploy.md` §5-6.
1. `edgegap_list_apps` → `edgegap_create_app` if needed → `edgegap_create_app_version`. Port named `gameport`, internal port = listen port, protocol matches the transport, **registry credentials set** (deploys fail to pull without them). WebSocket/WebGL: `WS` with `"tls_upgrade": true` on that port. Then `edgegap_list_app_versions` must show `registry_credentials_set: true` (and `tls_upgrade` on WS ports) before you deploy.
2. `edgegap_deploy` near the developer → `edgegap_wait_for_deployment` → `edgegap_get_deployment_logs`.
3. Prove the port answers: for WS ports, `curl --http1.1 -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==" --max-time 5 https://<fqdn>:<external>/` must print HTTP 101 (that also proves TLS Upgrade). Then the developer, or you, connects a real client directly to `fqdn`/`public_ip` + external port.
   `Unable to pull image from registry` here almost always means the version has no registry credentials. Developers often skip that dashboard field, so ask them to re-check it.
4. `edgegap_stop_deployment`.

✅ Check: a client played on the Edgegap server, and logs show the lifecycle script detected Edgegap. Don't build the matchmaker on top of an unproven server. Matchmaker symptoms of a broken server are confusing.

## Phase 5: Matchmaker

Read `references/matchmaker.md`.
1. Design the profile from the answers in Phase 0. For the first run, use a profile where a lone player gets a server after ~30 s, so one person can test.
2. Generate it with `edgegap_build_matchmaker_config` (or from `assets/matchmaker/*.json`). For WebGL pass `allowed_cors_origins` (every origin that serves the build, e.g. `http://localhost:8080`). Validate the JSON and save it as `matchmaker-config.json` in the project root.
3. Walk the developer through the dashboard (§5): Create Matchmaker → upload → Create and Start → copy **API URL** + **Auth Token**.
4. Check `GET <API URL>/monitor` with the token responds (DNS can take ~5 min).

✅ Check: monitor is healthy.

## Phase 6: Client integration

1. Put the API URL, Auth Token and profile name on `EdgegapMatchmakingClient` (inspector, or a ScriptableObject/config the game already uses). `UseLatencyBeacons` must match the profile: on only if it has a `latencies` rule, and never for WebGL.
2. Wire the game's "Play" button to `FindMatch()`/`CancelMatchmaking()`, and show `Status`. The built-in OnGUI panel is fine for a first test; hide it (`ShowGUI = false`) once the game's UI calls the methods.
3. If the server image changed in Phase 1-5 (it usually has), rebuild → push new tag → new app version → update `application.version` in the matchmaker (Stop → Edit → Start).

## Phase 7: End-to-end test and hand-off

1. Make sure no test deployment is running (`edgegap_list_deployments`).
2. Build the client with `-executeMethod EdgegapServerBuild.BuildClient -edgegapClientTarget webgl|win64|mac|linux` (output `Builds/Client/<target>`). For WebGL, serve it from an origin listed in `allowed_cors_origins`, e.g. `python -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1` in `Builds/Client/webgl` and open `http://localhost:8080`. If you have a browser tool you can run the two-tab test yourself: open two tabs and bring each to the front before clicking (background tabs throttle Unity WebGL and can miss clicks), then click Find Match in both. Otherwise the developer runs two clients (Editor + build, two builds, or two browser tabs). Watch: SEARCHING → MATCH_FOUND → HOST_ASSIGNED → connected, both in the same match. A solo client should get a server after the expansion delay.
3. While it runs: `edgegap_list_deployments` shows the matchmaker's deployment (tagged with ticket IDs); read its logs and confirm `N matched player(s)`.
4. Leave the match → server logs "Stopping deployment" → deployment disappears. That proves self-stop, which protects the developer's bill.
5. Debug with `references/troubleshooting.md` until this passes. Fix the root cause rather than working around it.

Hand-off summary: what was built, where the files are, the app/version/matchmaker names, how to ship a new build (build → push new tag → new version → update matchmaker version), free-tier caveats (matchmaker restarts every 3 h, one deployment at a time, 60-minute cap), and next steps (game UI for matchmaking, ticket-ID validation on the server, backfill/join-in-progress, a production matchmaker tier before launch).
