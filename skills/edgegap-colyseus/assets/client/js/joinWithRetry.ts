// Join a Colyseus room on a freshly started Edgegap deployment.
//
// Right after a ticket reaches HOST_ASSIGNED (or a deployment reports running), the deployment's
// address can answer 502 for a few seconds while the route to the container comes up. Retry the
// first join instead of failing; 10 attempts 2 s apart covered every case seen on Edgegap.
//
// Works with @colyseus/sdk (0.17) and colyseus.js (0.15/0.16): both expose client.joinOrCreate.
